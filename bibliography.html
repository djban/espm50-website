        <h2>Annotation 1</h2>
            <p><strong>“State Carbon Dioxide Emissions Data - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).”</strong></p>
            <p>
                The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) provides data on energy-related CO2 emissions through various tables, offering comprehensive insights into the carbon footprint associated with energy production and consumption in the United States. These data tables typically include information on CO2 emissions by energy source, sector, and state
            </p>
            <p>
                Energy Sources: The data tables break down CO2 emissions by different energy sources, such as coal, natural gas, petroleum, and renewables. This breakdown helps in understanding the contribution of each energy type to overall carbon emissions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Economic Sectors: Emissions data is often categorized by economic sectors, including but not limited to electricity generation, transportation, industrial processes, residential, and commercial. This segmentation allows for an analysis of which sectors are major contributors to CO2 emissions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Per Capita Emissions: Some tables may include per capita emissions data, providing insights into the average carbon footprint of individuals in different regions or sectors.

            <h2>Annotation 2</h2>
            <p><strong>Dalton, Michael.</strong> “Population Aging and Future Carbon Emissions in the United States.” International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, Apr. 2005, <a href="https://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/7810/1/IR-05-025.pdf" target="_blank">IR-05-025.pdf</a>.</p>

                The forthcoming decades may witness notable shifts in the demographic composition of households in the United States, potentially influencing both energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions.

            </p>
            <p>
                This study integrates population age dynamics into an energy-economic growth model featuring multiple generations of diverse households. Through this model, the article assesses and contrasts the impacts of population aging and technological advancements on the baseline trajectories of U.S. energy usage and emissions. 

            </p>
            <p>
                Findings indicate that population aging contributes to a significant reduction in long-term carbon dioxide emissions, with a nearly 40% decrease in a scenario characterized by lower population growth. Moreover, the study reveals that the effects of aging on emissions can be comparable to, or even surpass, the impacts of technological changes in certain instances.

            <h2>Annotation 3</h2>
            <p><strong>Jorgenson, Andrew, and Juliet Schor.</strong> “Income Inequality and Carbon Emissions in the United States: A State-Level Analysis, 1997–2012.” Ecological Economics, Elsevier, Dec. 2016, <a href="https://d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net" target="_blank">[Source]</a>.</p>
            <p>
                This research delves into the correlation between CO2 emissions at the U.S. state level and two indicators of income inequality: the income share held by the top 10% and the Gini coefficient. Each of these inequality metrics, capturing distinct aspects of income distributions, is employed to assess various analytical perspectives. 

            </p>
            <p>
                Findings from the longitudinal analysis spanning the period from 1997 to 2012 reveal a positive association between state-level emissions and the income share of the top 10%, while the impact of the Gini coefficient on emissions is deemed non-significant. The observed statistically significant link between CO2 emissions and the concentration of income among the top 10% aligns with analytical frameworks emphasizing political economy dynamics and Veblen effects, underscoring the potential political and economic influence and emulative impact of the affluent. 

            </p>
            <p>
                Conversely, the lack of a significant effect of the Gini coefficient generally contradicts the marginal propensity to emit approach, which suggests that a more equitable income distribution leads the less affluent to increase their consumption of energy and other carbon-intensive products as they transition into the middle class.

            <h2>Annotation 4</h2>
            <p><strong>Siebeneck, Todd, and Catherine Wang.</strong> Gross Domestic Product by State, Fourth Quarter and Annual 2018, Bureau of Economic Analysis, 1 May 2019, <a href="https://www.bea.gov/system/files/2019-04/qgdpstate0519_4.pdf" target="_blank">qgdpstate0519_4.pdf</a>.</p>
            <p>
                This report offers a comprehensive and detailed examination of state-level GDP data for the fourth quarter and the entire year of 2018, providing a solid foundation for understanding economic trends on a regional basis.

            </p>
            <p>
                One of the key strengths of this resource is that it takes a look at the economic performance in extreme detail which allows us to discern nuanced patterns and variations in economic activity across different states. 

            </p>
            <p>
                This level of detail is crucial for any project aiming to establish correlations between economic output and carbon emissions, as it allows for the identification of regional disparities and unique economic factors influencing emissions.

            </p>
            <p>
                Contains several tables which provides us with much of the necessary information and data that we could analyze in the future to find some trends amongst regions and states, although its accessibility is quite limited since it is a pdf table, and not a csv.
                The use of data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis adds a layer of credibility to the findings, given the reputation of the BEA as a premier source for economic statistics in the United States.

            <p><strong>Leichenko, R.M.</strong> (2000), Exports, Employment, and Production: A Causal Assessment of U.S. States and Regions. Economic Geography, 76: 303-325. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1944-8287.2000.tb00146.x" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1944-8287.2000.tb00146.x</a>.</p>
            <p>
                This research paper examines the often-assumed causal relationship between foreign exports and regional economic growth in the United States. As we don’t want to fall into the pitfalls of false assumptions, this was an important notice to watch out for.

            </p>
            <p>
                Despite the prevailing belief in the export base theory that considers exports as a catalyst for economic growth, empirical attention to the causality between foreign exports and regional economic growth has been limited. The traditional export base theory suggests that multiplier effects and externalities linked to export expansion are primary drivers of regional economic growth. The findings showed bidirectional causality between exports and state economic growth. However, the study also stated that there were variations among different regions in the United States, suggesting that the relationship between exports and economic growth is nuanced and context-dependent. 

            </p>
            <p>
                "Economic Geography" is a well-regarded peer-reviewed academic journal that focuses on the spatial aspects of economic systems, so I believe that it should be well considered in our project.

            <h2>Annotation 6</h2>
            <p><a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/state-ghg-emissions-and-removals" target="_blank">State GHG Emissions and Removals | US EPA</a>.</p>
            <p>
                This website provides comprehensive data on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and removals at the state level, offering a perspective that is crucial for our project focused on understanding regional variations of carbon emissions. This is from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), so this is quite credible when it comes to data collection. However, it should be noted that false reporting may occur, although that is purely speculation.

            </p>
            <p>
                Greenhouse gas Inventory Data Explorer: Visual data representation of all the different types of greenhouse gas producers, and how they vary by state. Although it’s accessible and nice to have, it’s not as important for us, who only need to collect the data at the moment, and not have it look pretty just yet.

            </p>
            <p>
                Contains full peer-reviewed EPA methodology report and data appendices for all of it’s information. We might be able to scrape the data off of the data explorer, or find some pdf/csv file of this information which would be greatly helpful in finding the general trends and the emissions for each state.
