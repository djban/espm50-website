        <p>North Dakota has a significant reliance on fossil fuels, particularly coal and oil. While the state contributes to national energy production, it faces challenges related to carbon emissions. Efforts to diversify the energy mix and explore cleaner technologies are ongoing, and the state is involved in discussions around sustainable energy practices.</p>
