                <h1>North Carolina Carbon Emissions</h1>
                <p>North Carolina, a leader in solar energy production, exports chemicals. Efforts to transition away from coal and increase energy efficiency contribute to the state's commitment to reducing carbon emissions. North Carolina's culture reflects a growing awareness of environmental issues, particularly in addressing the impacts of hurricanes and coastal resilience.</p>
