        <h1>Utah Carbon Emissions</h1>
        <p>Utah has a significant reliance on fossil fuels, including coal and natural gas. The state is making efforts to increase renewable energy capacity, particularly in solar and geothermal. Utah's unique landscapes, including national parks, underscore the importance of balancing economic interests with environmental conservation. The culture values outdoor recreation and environmental stewardship.</p>
