        <p>Idaho's energy mix includes hydropower, geothermal, and a growing interest in wind and solar energy. The state is working on diversifying its energy sources and increasing energy efficiency. Balancing economic interests, particularly in agriculture, with environmental conservation is a consideration for Idaho.</p>
