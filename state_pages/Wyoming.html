                <h1>Wyoming Carbon Emissions</h1>
                <p>Wyoming has abundant fossil fuel resources, including coal, natural gas, and oil. The state is working on increasing renewable energy capacity, particularly in wind power. Balancing economic interests tied to the energy industry with efforts to address environmental impacts is a focus for Wyoming. The culture values the state's wide-open spaces and is increasingly mindful of sustainable energy practices.</p>
