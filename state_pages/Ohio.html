                <h1>Ohio Carbon Emissions</h1>
                <p>Ohio, historically reliant on coal, is diversifying its energy mix while facing economic challenges. The state's transportation equipment export contributes to carbon emissions, but ongoing efforts in renewable energy and emission reduction are evident. Ohio's culture is evolving as it navigates the transition from traditional fossil fuels to a more sustainable energy landscape.</p>
