        <p>Indiana has historically relied on coal for a substantial portion of its energy production. While the state has been working to diversify its energy sources, including a growing interest in natural gas and renewables, there are ongoing challenges in reducing dependence on fossil fuels. Initiatives to enhance energy efficiency and explore cleaner energy options are gaining attention. Indiana faces considerations of balancing economic interests tied to manufacturing with environmental sustainability.</p>
