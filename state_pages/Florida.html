                <h1>Florida Carbon Emissions</h1>
                <p>Florida, facing environmental challenges due to hurricanes and sea-level rise, has a major export in computer and electronic products. The state's dependence on tourism and coastal development poses challenges in managing environmental impacts, while efforts in solar energy adoption contribute to carbon reduction. Florida's culture is shaped by a delicate balance between economic interests and preserving its natural beauty.</p>
