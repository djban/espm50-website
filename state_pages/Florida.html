        <p>Florida faces environmental challenges due to its vulnerability to hurricanes and sea-level rise. The state has been working on resilience measures and renewable energy initiatives. While there's progress in solar energy adoption, Florida's dependence on tourism and coastal development presents challenges in managing environmental impacts.</p>
