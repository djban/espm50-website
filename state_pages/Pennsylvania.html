                <h1>Pennsylvania Carbon Emissions</h1>
                <p>Pennsylvania, with chemicals as a major export, has a diverse energy profile, historically relying on coal and natural gas. In recent years, there's been a shift towards cleaner energy sources, including renewables. The state faces challenges related to legacy pollution from industrial activities, and ongoing efforts focus on balancing economic interests with environmental sustainability.</p>
