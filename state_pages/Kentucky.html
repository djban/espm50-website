        <p>Kentucky has a historical reliance on coal for energy, and this has contributed to carbon emissions. The state is gradually diversifying its energy sources, with a focus on renewable energy initiatives. Challenges include balancing economic interests tied to the coal industry with efforts to address environmental impacts.</p>
