        <h1>Kentucky Carbon Emissions</h1>
        <p>Kentucky has a historical reliance on coal for energy, and this has contributed to carbon emissions. The state is gradually diversifying its energy sources, with a focus on renewable energy initiatives. Challenges include balancing economic interests tied to the coal industry with efforts to address environmental impacts. Kentucky's culture is evolving as it seeks a balance between its industrial history and a more sustainable future.</p>
