        <h1>Rhode Island Carbon Emissions</h1>
        <p>Rhode Island has been proactive in promoting renewable energy and reducing carbon emissions. The state has set goals for offshore wind energy and energy efficiency initiatives. Coastal resilience is crucial for Rhode Island due to its extensive shoreline, and efforts are underway to address the impacts of sea-level rise. Rhode Island's culture values coastal living and environmental stewardship.</p>
