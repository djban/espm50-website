            <p>
                Welcome to our website! This website was aimed to aggregate data from several sources to help individuals understand the 
                relationship different states have with their major exports and their carbon emissions. We hope that this website will help users better understand the impact major exports and carbon emissions has on
                the economic and cultural identity of each state.

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
                Our project is dedicated to the creation of a comprehensive platform aimed at documenting and tracking carbon
                 emissions on a state-level basis, while also providing valuable insights into the carbon footprint associated 
                 with the goods produced in each state. Our site will offer a user-friendly interface that encourages users 
                 to explore, compare, and assess the environmental impact of different regions and products. 
                 This project aims to foster a greater transparency, awareness, and accountability of states in the pursuit of a more sustainable future.
